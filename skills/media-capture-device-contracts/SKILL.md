description: "Use when browser camera or microphone capture stays blocked after denial, reports the wrong recovery, fails when a device is unplugged or switched, opens the same device twice, or leaves the camera light or microphone active after replacement, navigation, or unmount. Top-level browser getUserMedia session, device-change, and MediaStreamTrack ownership scope; use iframe-embed-contracts for embedded capability delegation, webview-bridge-pages for native WebView permissions, user-activation-contracts only when a separate gesture-gated API fails with trusted-event timing evidence, and a recording-specific workflow for MediaRecorder final-chunk semantics."

# Media capture device contracts

A camera or microphone flow is a session lifecycle, not a one-time permission
check. The contract is to request the intended tracks, represent the actual
failure, recover without promising a browser prompt, replace devices without
leaking capture, and release every track the page owns.

## Checklist

1. Reproduce in a supported browser with the actual origin, browsing context,
   requested constraints, and device state. Record whether the context is
   secure and whether `navigator.mediaDevices` exists before interpreting a
   rejection as user denial.
2. Trace one request from `getUserMedia()` through stream attachment and
   teardown. Identify which component or session owns each returned track,
   clone, event listener, and media element.
3. Classify the actual exception instead of mapping every failure to
   "permission denied":
   - First separate API availability. An insecure context can leave
     `navigator.mediaDevices` unavailable, so handle a missing API or resulting
     `TypeError` before interpreting a callable request's rejection.
   - `NotAllowedError` can indicate denied capture or an applicable capability
     policy. Route an iframe policy failure to `iframe-embed-contracts`.
   - `NotFoundError` means the requested track type has no matching source.
   - `NotReadableError` means capture could not start despite permission,
     including browser, operating-system, or hardware access failures.
   - `OverconstrainedError` identifies constraints that no candidate can
     satisfy; record the reported constraint when the browser provides it.
   - Treat `AbortError`, `InvalidStateError`, `TypeError`, and other failures
     according to the captured browser evidence rather than relabeling them.
4. Model explicit states such as `idle`, `requesting`, `live`, `interrupted`,
   `denied`, `no-device`, `unreadable`, `constraints-failed`, and `stopped`.
   Commit `live` only after a current stream is attached and its required
   tracks are live and not `muted`. A user can leave the browser prompt
   unanswered, so do not convert a still-pending request into denial. Let the
   UI dismiss or supersede that attempt, then dispose of any stream that
   resolves late.
5. Keep recovery truthful:
   - After denial, offer an explicit retry and accurate browser-settings help;
     do not claim JavaScript can force the permission prompt to reopen.
   - For no-device or device removal, use `devicechange` where the target
     browser exposes it, reconcile again on explicit retry, and let the user
     select an available device.
   - For an unreadable device, release tracks the session owns before retrying
     and avoid telling the user that permission is necessarily missing.
   - Relax an overconstrained request only when the product accepts the
     fallback. Report the degraded mode instead of silently changing it.
6. Use the Permissions API only as optional diagnostic context when the
   browser exposes the relevant descriptor. A permission query can reject or
   omit part of the capture decision; the `getUserMedia()` result and live
   track state remain authoritative.
7. Make device replacement a defined ownership transition. Do not open a
   second capture merely to preview the source when an owned track or
   deliberately owned clone can satisfy the use case. If replacement requires
   a new stream, attach the accepted replacement and stop/detach the old
   owned stream exactly once. If the platform cannot open both concurrently,
   represent the interruption while releasing the old source first.
8. Handle temporary and permanent interruption separately. An owned track can
   retain `readyState === "live"` while `muted === true` because its source is
   temporarily unable to provide media. On `mute`, move the UI to a truthful
   `interrupted` state without declaring the track stopped; on `unmute`,
   return to `live` only if the same current track is still owned, live, and
   unmuted. Use the `ended` event for source-ended paths. Calling `stop()`
   sets `readyState` to `ended` but does not fire that event, so the owner must
   perform its own stopped-state transition and cleanup. Reconcile the device
   list after `devicechange`, and do not report healthy capture while a
   required track is muted.
9. On replacement, cancellation, route change, or unmount, remove listeners,
   clear pending-request ownership, detach media elements (`srcObject = null`
   where the page assigned it), and call `stop()` on every track this session
   owns. If a late request resolves after disposal, stop its tracks
   immediately instead of attaching them. Register and remove `mute`,
   `unmute`, and `ended` handlers as one idempotent per-track ownership unit so
   replaced tracks cannot update the current session.
10. Do not stop a borrowed track without an ownership contract. Stopping one
    track ends that track, but a shared camera or microphone source can remain
    active while another track still uses it.

## Quick probes

- Log a request generation, constraints, exception `name`, reported
  `constraint`, track IDs, `readyState`, and owning session at each transition.
  Avoid logging device labels or identifiers unless the debugging environment
  permits that data.
- Count live owned tracks before capture, after device replacement, and after
  unmount. The final count must return to zero.
- Deny capture, retry from the recovery UI, and verify that the UI never says
  the camera is active before a live track is attached.
- Unplug or disable the selected device, then restore or select another one.
  Verify one recovery path and no duplicate listeners or streams.
- Temporarily interrupt the source without ending its track. Assert
  `readyState === "live"` with `muted === true` produces an interrupted UI,
  then confirm `unmute` restores the same current session without reacquiring
  or duplicating tracks.
- Delay `getUserMedia()`, unmount before it resolves, and assert that the late
  stream is stopped and never assigned to the media element.

## Boundary with sibling skills

- `iframe-embed-contracts` owns `allow`, sandbox, and Permissions Policy
  capability delegation between parent and guest documents.
- `webview-bridge-pages` owns native app permission and WebView host lifecycle.
- A `getUserMedia()` rejection alone does not route to
  `user-activation-contracts`. Use that skill only when a distinct
  gesture-gated operation, such as playback or fullscreen, fails and the
  trusted-event timing or activation-consumption boundary is in evidence.
- Recording finalization, encoded chunks, and `MediaRecorder` stop/data event
  ordering require a recording-specific workflow. This skill owns the input
  tracks only.
- Generic geolocation, notifications, and unrelated permission prompts are out
  of scope.

## PR-worthiness gate

Require a real browser capture sequence that identifies the requested media
kind, exception or track transition, owning session, and user-visible wrong
state or leaked resource. A fix must preserve truthful recovery and add a
regression for the failing denial, mute/unmute, device-change, replacement, or
teardown sequence. Use a physical or controlled virtual camera/microphone for
the live path and browser-controlled permission state for denial; mocked unit
tests are supplemental, not proof of browser capture behavior. Use
[`references/real-device-validation.md`](references/real-device-validation.md)
when the claim includes native permission UI, OS indicators, or hardware.

The bundled localhost Chromium fake-device casebook exercises real
`getUserMedia()` acquisition plus in-page stream attachment, replacement, late
resolution, and teardown checks. A second Playwright matrix runs the same
application-owned lifecycle with browser-created synthetic `MediaStream`
tracks in the bundled Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit engines. The matrix is
cross-engine application lifecycle evidence, not native permission,
`getUserMedia()`, branded Safari, OS permission UI, physical unplug/mute, or
real camera/microphone hardware evidence.

Reject weak findings: the mere presence of `getUserMedia()`, `enumerateDevices()`,
or a permission query; an empty or redacted device label before permission; a
stopped borrowed track whose owner intentionally keeps the source active; an
unsupported browser claim with no target-browser evidence; or an iframe,
native WebView, or recording-finalization defect that belongs to another
workflow. A click handler, `await`, or capture rejection without a distinct
gated API failure and trusted-event timing evidence is not an activation
finding. A single `mute` or `unmute` listener is not a defect when the UI,
current-track guard, and teardown remain truthful and idempotent.

## Output shape

Start with a disposition: confirmed, candidate/needs evidence, reject, or route.
Report the browser/context and requested constraints, observed exception or
track transition, `readyState` and `muted` evidence, current UI state versus
real track state, ownership and listener/media-element evidence, smallest
recovery or teardown change, sibling handoff when applicable, and the
real-browser/device regression that confirms the intended result. State any
untested denial, mute/unmute, unplug, switch, or late-resolution path instead
of assuming it works.
